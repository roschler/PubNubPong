PubNubPong
==========

Fun multiplayer game that combines Ping Pong and Breakout, powered by the PubNub real-time messaging service.

This game is an ad hoc fork of the Bricks3D project Robin Mitra who released it into the public domain:

A big thanks to Robin for making the source code for such a fun game available to everyone.  This project takes the original game, which was a single-player Breakout style game, and makes a multi-player game that can be played over the Web with the help of the PubNub network.

NOTE: This is just an initial commit that should not be downloaded yet.  Although the code is finished, it has not been tested yet at all.
